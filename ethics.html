Classical utilitarianism considers the action that maximizes utility to be the moral action. To determine the ethical grounds for vigilantism under this standard, one must determine whether these actions promote the same “greatest happiness of the greatest number” that Jeremy Bentham describes. Such an assessment confronts many of the common criticisms of utilitarianism, most notably the claim of impracticality. This criticism of utilitarianism argues that utility cannot be quantified or measured—one cannot, in practice, calculate all the effects for all the individuals. Admittedly, the number of individuals affected by vigilantism makes the utilitarian calculus impossible in many cases. Consider the actions of Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, through a utilitarian lens. By releasing sensitive government documents that have garnered front-page news coverage, Assange has managed to influence the utility of the American commoner. But does the reality of WikiLeaks offer a greater happiness to the commoner than the ignorance in its absence? A poll by The Washington Post and ABC News  found that most Americans (68 percent) say the WikiLeaks’ exposure of government documents harms the public interest. Nearly as many (59 percent) say the U.S. government should arrest Assange and charge him with a crime for releasing the diplomatic cables (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/14/AR2010121401650.html">Chaiken</a>). While this poll claims to represent the entire “public,” summing over the utilities of this many commoners still seems incalculable. Furthermore, acts of vigilantism often result in unexpected consequences; the variability of consequences of vigilantism makes utilitarianism an inconsistent standard of morality.

Deontology offers an alternative moral philosophy, agnostic of the consequences. This moral assessment relies on the categorical imperative—could one will the act to become a universal law? To evaluate the moral grounds for vigilantism by this standard, one must evaluate the wills of the individuals who engage in vigilantism. Consider Assange: the morality of his actions must be evaluated on their intent, not consequences. Although the publication of American operatives in enemy territories on Wikileaks resulted in their murders, these consequences must be disregarded according to deontology.

We define four principal circumstances in which one might engage in vigilantism:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li style="font-size: 20px"><strong class="text-primary">The state has enacted good laws but is failing to enforce them</br></strong>
                Philosophy professor Travis Dumsday (Concordia University, College of Alberta) believes two factors are important in answering this question: the extent to which the laws are not being enforced and the motivation behind the existing failure to enforce (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-6962.2009.tb00131.x/epdf">Dumsday</a>). According to Dumsday, “If the government is being truly, deficient in protecting its citizens from major crimes, then those citizens have the right to protect themselves and one another through individual and communal effort” (Dumsday). Notably, Dumsday regards vigilantism permissible only if the state is genuinely unwilling or unable to provide appropriate protection. Dumsday would consider the wills of individuals who engage in vigilantism to be unethical, given the willingness of legislators and prosecutors to provide protection from such criminals. While Dumsday offers reasonable moral commentary, this situation doesn’t apply to our state; our state enforces the laws it has enacted well.
              </li>
              <li style="font-size: 20px"><strong class="text-primary">The state has failed to enact certain good laws</br></strong>
Unlike the previous situation, this situation may apply to our state. By whose standard can laws be labeled “good” or “bad”? Often Internet vigilantism occurs when an individual believes existing laws to be “bad.” Edward Snowden leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) because he believed the state failed to enact certain “good” laws to protect the individual’s right to privacy. Who gets to determine whether such a law to limit government surveillance would be good or bad? A closer study of the three policies that individuals adopt to change laws may provide an answer to this question. Individuals who want to change laws, including individuals who engage in vigilantism, subscribe to one of three policies: 1) defer to the legislative process, 2) break the law and accept the consequences or 3) break the law and don’t accept the consequences. Individuals who break the law and do not accept the consequences. Deontological moral philosophy argues that individuals who break the law must accept the consequences; therefore, Kant would regard this position of vigilantism to be unethical. The categorical imperative compels individuals to “act only according to that maxim whereby [they] can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.” According to this standard, vigilantism is unethical.
              </li>
              <li style="font-size: 20px"><strong class="text-primary">The state has enacted evil laws</br></strong>
In this situation, vigilantism ought to be permissible. Dumsday imagines a state that decrees husbands must beat their wives at least four times a year. In such a case, he argues, it is both “permissible and obligatory” for citizens to disobey this law.
              </li>

              <li style="font-size: 20px"><strong class="text-primary">The state has enacted good laws and is enforcing them:</br></strong>
Here, vigilantism would be considered impermissible.              </li>

            </ul>

                <strong class="text-primary">PyCon Dongle Incident</strong>: In 2013 a woman overheard an offensive remark at the PyCon conference about comparing dongles to ‘dongs.’ She photographed the person, and published his quote and his photo on twitter. A few days later, the individuals responsible lost their jobs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong class="text-primary">Zhang Ya, Sichuan Earthquake</strong>: A girl who published a 4-minute video complaining about how much coverage the Sichuan earthquake was getting had her personal information found out and broadcasted by digilantes. Along with abusive video responses she received multiple death threats and had to be taken into police custody.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong class="text-primary">Boston Marathon</strong>:
                After the Boston Marathon bombing, a huge chunk of the internet community began a crowdsourced effort to identify the suspect based on the database of released photos. Eventually, the New York Post ran an article with the headline  "Bag men: Feds seek these two pictured at Boston Marathon" using a photo put forward by one of the digital investigators without FBI approval. These 2 men were innocent, but the event compromised both their privacy and safety.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead">
              Some could say that crowdsourcing criminal identification efforts provide far-reaching, immediate impact. However, the information that is crowdsourced is often not the whole picture, and more importantly–looking for and digitally broadcasting information has the potential to create an unhealthy surveillance culture that America has worked hard to stave off.
