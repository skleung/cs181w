Though not specifically directed towards a school context, broadly state legislatures have defined varying degrees of severity against the act of cyberbullying, which is defined as “the willful and repeated use of cell phones, computers, and other electronic communication devices to harass and threaten others.” (<a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/cyberbullying.aspx">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>)

              <p class="lead">
                Against cyberattacks, federal legislation includes mandates to tighten and protect online systems and data. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) are the primary vehicles of these measures, though there are additional bills that recommend practical ways the government can work with cyberintelligence organizations to prevent cyberattacks.

              <h4>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</h4>
              <p class="lead">
                Enacted by Congress in 1986 as an amendment to the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/17732839">Channing</a>). The CFAA criminalized computer-related acts like the distribution of malicious code and denial of service attacks (Channing). It has been amended a total of six times between 1989 and 2008 (Channing). The statute’s reach has been expanded each time. The CFAA was originally intended to encompass only computer crimes of a federal interest. Its regulations now encompass every use of every computer in the US (<a href="http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v27/27HarvJLTech301.pdf">Li</a>). The CFAA expressly prohibits vigilantism. Even retaliating against a hacker by “counter hacking” is not a valid defense to criminal prosecution (Li).
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
The CFAA has been broadly applied by the federal government to prosecute instances of internet vigilantism. On November 15, 2013, a self-described “vigilante” Jeremy Hammond was sentenced to 10 years in prison for obtaining and publishing confidential information from Strategic Forecasting (Stratfor), a private defense firm (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/20/hacktivists-government_n_4460489.html">Smith</a>). The documents revealed that Stratfor had engaged in surveillance of political protesters at the behest of both private companies and the US government (Smith). He was prosecuted under the CFAA under 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(2), which criminalizes “obtaining information from any protected computer” if the user does not have authorization (Smith).
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
In the aftermath of several controversial cases, most notably that of US v. Aaron Swartz, there has been a growing movement to reform the CFAA (Smith). The vast scope and ambiguity around many of its provisions have meant that government prosecutors have a large license to charge and request severe sentences for cases of hacktivism or cyber vigilantism. Most observers point to 18 U.S.C. 1030, where the terms “access without authorization” and “exceeds authorized access” are left open to wide interpretation (Smith). As well, legislation known as Aaron’s Law was introduced in the House in the wake of Aaron Swartz’s suicide, seeking to exclude violations of terms of service agreements from the CFAA. However, such reform efforts have remained encumbered by pressure from corporate interests, which see the CFAA provisions as vital to preserving their IP (Channing).

              <h4>Other Legislation</h4>
              <p class="lead">
Related legislation include the Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 and the currently proposed CISPA bill that is awaiting Senate approval. Both bills provide detailed measures to encourage and facilitate the communication of cyber threat information between the private sector and the federal government.
              </p>
              <p class="class">
The National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish a national cybersecurity and communications integration center in the Department of Homeland Security (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2519">113th Congress</a>). The bill charges the center to ensure: (1) continuous, collaborative, and inclusive coordination across sectors and with sector coordinating councils, information sharing and analysis organizations, and other appropriate non-federal partners; (2) development and use of technology-neutral, real-time mechanisms for sharing information about risks and incidents; and (3) safeguards against unauthorized access.
              </p>

              <p class="class">
A previous version of the currently proposed bill, Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, CISPA was passed in the House but was defeated in the Senate in 2013 (<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr624ih/pdf/BILLS-113hr624ih.pdf">113th Congress</a>). The bill provides federal support and guidelines in the sharing of cyber threat intelligence and information between the intelligence community and cybersecurity entities.  As of February 2015, the Obama administration has supported the bill’s efforts to “encourage the private sector to share appropriate cyber information” with the Department of Homeland Security
