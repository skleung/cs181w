            <p class="lead">
Deontology offers an alternative moral philosophy, agnostic of the consequences. This moral assessment relies on the categorical imperative—could one will the act to become a universal law? To evaluate the moral grounds for vigilantism by this standard, one must evaluate the wills of the individuals who engage in vigilantism. Consider Assange: the morality of his actions must be evaluated on their intent, not consequences. Although the publication of American operatives in enemy territories on Wikileaks resulted in their murders, these consequences must be disregarded according to deontology.

            <p class="lead">
We define four principal circumstances in which one might engage in vigilantism:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li style="font-size: 20px"><strong class="text-primary">The state has enacted good laws but is failing to enforce them</br></strong>
                Philosophy professor Travis Dumsday (Concordia University, College of Alberta) believes two factors are important in answering this question: the extent to which the laws are not being enforced and the motivation behind the existing failure to enforce (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-6962.2009.tb00131.x/epdf">Dumsday</a>). According to Dumsday, “If the government is being truly, deficient in protecting its citizens from major crimes, then those citizens have the right to protect themselves and one another through individual and communal effort” (Dumsday). Notably, Dumsday regards vigilantism permissible only if the state is genuinely unwilling or unable to provide appropriate protection. Dumsday would consider the wills of individuals who engage in vigilantism to be unethical, given the willingness of legislators and prosecutors to provide protection from such criminals. While Dumsday offers reasonable moral commentary, this situation doesn’t apply to our state; our state enforces the laws it has enacted well.
              </li>
              <li style="font-size: 20px"><strong class="text-primary">The state has failed to enact certain good laws</br></strong>
Unlike the previous situation, this situation may apply to our state. By whose standard can laws be labeled “good” or “bad”? Often Internet vigilantism occurs when an individual believes existing laws to be “bad.” Edward Snowden leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) because he believed the state failed to enact certain “good” laws to protect the individual’s right to privacy. Who gets to determine whether such a law to limit government surveillance would be good or bad? A closer study of the three policies that individuals adopt to change laws may provide an answer to this question. Individuals who want to change laws, including individuals who engage in vigilantism, subscribe to one of three policies: 1) defer to the legislative process, 2) break the law and accept the consequences or 3) break the law and don’t accept the consequences. Individuals who break the law and do not accept the consequences. Deontological moral philosophy argues that individuals who break the law must accept the consequences; therefore, Kant would regard this position of vigilantism to be unethical. The categorical imperative compels individuals to “act only according to that maxim whereby [they] can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.” According to this standard, vigilantism is unethical.
              </li>
              <li style="font-size: 20px"><strong class="text-primary">The state has enacted evil laws</br></strong>
In this situation, vigilantism ought to be permissible. Dumsday imagines a state that decrees husbands must beat their wives at least four times a year. In such a case, he argues, it is both “permissible and obligatory” for citizens to disobey this law.
              </li>

              <li style="font-size: 20px"><strong class="text-primary">The state has enacted good laws and is enforcing them:</br></strong>
Here, vigilantism would be considered impermissible.              </li>
