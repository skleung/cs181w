              <small>Alliances between Police and Cyber-vigilantes</small>
            </h3>
            <p class="lead">
Federal agencies sometimes form alliances with cyber-vigilantes to combat crime, within the framework of the law. One notable example is the FBIâ€™s partnership with Perverted Justice to catch pedophiles (<a href="https://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_review/v57/05-Winters_Final.pdf">Winters</a>). Perverted Justice is a watchdog group composed of cyber-vigilantes who seek to unmask online predators. They obtain law enforcement approval to establish sting operations (Winters). This would involve having a vigilante mask himself as a minor to bait online predators. The pedophile is invited to meet with the minor, at which point he or she is arrested by the authorities. The alliance has yielded an impressive conviction rate, as most offenders who are caught plead guilty (Winters).

            <p class="lead">
However, some legal observers have raised concerns about such an alignment between law enforcement and vigilantes. Are such cyber-vigilantes like Perverted Justice held to the same statutory and constitutional standards of investigative conduct that the police are required to follow? What are the legal implications if a vigilant fails to follow these standards and puts convictions at jeopardy? Some have suggested the need to establish strict protocols if such alliances are to be formed. These should include training for vigilantes on how to handle evidence, as well as how to avoid situations where the defendant could escape due to legal technicalities such as pleading entrapment (Winters).

              <p class="lead">
Cyber-vigilantism presents a host of ethical challenges. One the one hand, when done to redress an injustice or to expose criminal activity, vigilantes contribute to a more just and transparent society in ways that law enforcement officials often cannot. On the other hand, digilantes usually act outside the scope of the law to achieve their objectives. Rule of law and due process are cornerstones of a democratic society. If an exception is made for cyber vigilantes, it would create a dangerous precedent in which a subset of society are allowed to act according to a different standard. A way to reconcile this may be through more active alliances between digilante groups and law enforcement agencies. However, with the restrictive legislation that currently controls online activity, a legal reconceptualization of cyberspace is necessary before such partnerships may prove effective.                <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/cfaa">(Electronic Frontier Foundation)</a>
